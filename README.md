## Scientific Computing

### Learning Outcomes

CME 108 offers an introduction to a set of tools to solve engineering calculus problems, e.g., integration, interpolation, etc., using numerical techniques. The goals of this course are:
1. To familiarize with several basic numerical methods applied to engineering calculus such as differentiation, integration, etc.; and to understand the behavior or limitation of these methods.
2. To apply numerical methods to engineering problems through Matlab programming. This is a 3-unit course.

### Topics

- Numerical integration
- Linear algebra
- Interpolation
- Non-linear equations (root finding)
- Minimization
- Numerical solution of Ordinary Differential Equations
- Numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations
